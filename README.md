 time comparison between insert sort  algorithm and heap sot algorithm 
 this was my data structure project of univercity and in this 
 case time is important and time of heap sort is less than insert
 sort because of time complexty of heap sort.
 if time was 0 run again and again to sho the time like 0.0098
